Awib is a brainfuck compiler written in brainfuck.

Notable features are code optimization, portability and support for
multiple target platforms.

As of version 0.2, awib is a 3-language polyglot; in addition to being
fully functional brainfuck, it is also compileable C and executable
bash script.


== Usage

Feed awib brainfuck source code as input and the compiled program
will be written as output.

Awib is a cross-compiler. The supported target platforms are
listed in table 1. By default, the target "lang_c" is chosen.

To specify a target platform, insert a line on the form "@TARGET"
(without the quotation marks and with "TARGET" suitably replaced)
at the very beginning of the source code you wish to compile.
Awib will then produce output accordingly.

 +----------------+--------------------------------------------+
 |   TARGET       |   Description                              |
 +----------------+--------------------------------------------+
 | 386_linux      | Linux on i386                              |
 +----------------+--------------------------------------------+
 | lang_c         | C programming language                     |
 +----------------+--------------------------------------------+
 | lang_ruby      | Ruby programming language                  |
 +----------------+--------------------------------------------+
 | lang_go        | Go programming language                    |
 +----------------+--------------------------------------------+
       Table 1 - Available target platforms

For instance, the following input would produce an executable hello
world-program for Linux:

  @386_linux
  ++++++[->++++++++++++<]>.----[--<+++>]<-.+++++++..+++.[--->+<]>-----.--
  -[-<+++>]<.---[--->++++<]>-.+++.------.--------.-[---<+>]<.[--->+<]>-.

The following would produce a hello world-program in Ruby:

  @lang_ruby
  ++++++[->++++++++++++<]>.----[--<+++>]<-.+++++++..+++.[--->+<]>-----.--
  -[-<+++>]<.---[--->++++<]>-.+++.------.--------.-[---<+>]<.[--->+<]>-.

And this would give you the hello world-program in C:

  @lang_c
  ++++++[->++++++++++++<]>.----[--<+++>]<-.+++++++..+++.[--->+<]>-----.--
  -[-<+++>]<.---[--->++++<]>-.+++.------.--------.-[---<+>]<.[--->+<]>-.


== Optimizations

Awib is an optimizing compiler:

 o) Sequences of '-','>','<' and '+' are contracted into single
    instructions. E.g. "----" is replaced with a single SUB(4).

 o) Mutually cancelling instructions are reduced. E.g. "+++-->><"
    is equivalent to "+>" and is compiled accordingly.

 o) Some common constructs are identified and replaced with single
    instructions. E.g. "[-]" is compiled into a single CLEAR-
    instruction.

 o) Loops known to never be entered are removed. This is the case
    for loops opened at the very beginning of a program (when all
    cells are 0) and loops opened immediately after the closing
    of another loop.


== Requirements

Awib will run smoothly in any brainfuck environment where:

   o) Cells are 8-bit or larger

   o) The read instruction ',' (comma) issued after end of
      input results in 0 being written OR -1 being written
      OR no change being made to the cell at all.

The vast majority of brainfuck environments meet these criteria.


== Environment

Code compiled with awib will execute in an environment where:

   o) Cells are 8-bit wrapping integers.

   o) Issuing the read instruction ',' (comma) after
      end of input results in the current cell being
      left as is  (no-change on EOF).

   o) At least 2^16-1 = 65535 cells are available.

   o) Operating beyond the available memory, in either
      direction, results in undefined behaviour.
