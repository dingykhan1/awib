## About

Also Written In Brainfuck (awib) is an optimizing brainfuck
compiler, 100% written in brainfuck. Awib reads brainfuck source
code as input and writes compiled programs as output. Awib is
a cross-compiler with several different target platforms available.

This README is intended for experienced users who want condensed
information regarding usage and behaviour of awib.


## Requirements

Awib will run smoothly in any brainfuck environment where:

   o) Cells are 8-bit or larger

   o) The read instruction ',' (comma) issued after end of
      input results in 0 being written OR -1 being written
      OR no change being made to the cell at all.

The vast majority of brainfuck environments match these criteria.


## Environment

Code compiled with awib will execute in an environment where:

   o) Cells are 8-bit wrapping integers.

   o) Issuing the read instruction ',' (comma) after
      end of input results in the current cell being
      left as is  (no-change on EOF).

   o) At least 2^16-1 = 65535 cells are available (the exact
      size depends on the target platform).

   o) Operating beyond the available memory, in either
      direction, results in undefined behaviour.


## Usage

Run awib in your brainfuck environment of choice. Feed brainfuck
source code to awib as input and the compiled program will be
written as output.

Awib is a cross-compiler. The supported target platforms are
listed in table 1. By default, the target "386_linux" is chosen.

To specify a target platform, insert a line on the form "@TARGET"
(without the quotation marks and with "TARGET" suitably replaced)
at the very beginning of the source code you wish to compile.
Awib will then produce output accordingly.

 +----------------+--------------------------------------------+
 |   TARGET       |   Description                              |
 +----------------+--------------------------------------------+
 | 386_linux      | Linux on i386                              |
 +----------------+--------------------------------------------+
 | lang_c         | C programming language                     |

## Optimizations

Awib is an optimizing compiler:

 o) Sequences of '-','<','>' and '+' are contracted into single
    instructions. E.g. "----" is replaced with a single ADD(4).

 o) Mutually cancelling instructions are reduced. E.g. "+++--<>>"
    is equivalent to "+>" and is compiled accordingly.

 o) Some common constructs are identified and replaced with single
    instructions. E.g. "[-]" is compiled into a single CLEAR-
    instruction.

 o) Loops known to never be entered are removed. This is the case
    for loops opened at the very beginning of a program (when all
    cells are 0) and loops opened immediately after the closing
    of another loop.
